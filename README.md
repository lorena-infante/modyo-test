# Front End Developer Challenge - Modyo

This project assigned by Modyo has for an end to create a Landing Page using the different assets (given and not given) by the company to recreate a web and mobile version of a demo page.

## Technologies and Extra features

Technologies used in this project were: HTML, CSS and Javascript.

In order to give the Landing Page a more appealing look and feel, I added two extra fonts: Montserrat and Nunito (both taken from Google Fonts).

The icons used for "Features" section were downloaded from freeepik.com and modified by me in Adobe Illustrator.

Additionally, I have added more items to the given mockup mobile version on the png archive.

For the "Testimonials" section I used the Api Fetch to bring the users and their opinions from the API URL given by Modyo:

# Front End Developer Challenge - Modyo

<b>THIS FILE SHOULD BE OPENED FROM THE CODE EDITOR, OTHERWISE JAVASCRIPT FILES WILL NOT SHOW UP</b>

This project assigned by Modyo has for an end to create a Landing Page using the different assets (given and not given) by the company to recreate a web and mobile version of a demo page.



## Technologies and Extra features

Technologies used in this project were: HTML, CSS and Javascript.

In order to give the Landing Page a more appealing look and feel, I added two extra fonts: Montserrat and Nunito (both taken from Google Fonts).

The icons used for "Features" section were downloaded from freeepik.com and modified by me in Adobe Illustrator.

Additionally, I have added more items to the given mockup mobile version on the png archive.

## API Fetch

For the "Testimonials" section I used the Api Fetch to bring the users and their opinions from the API URL given by Modyo: 
<a href="https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users">Users</a>,
<a href="https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts">Text</a>


** Posts and users showed are the first 4 objects of the JSON file obtailed by the API
## Carousel
In order to make a responsive carousel/slider I used the <b>Glider.js<b> library, you can access to it <a href="https://nickpiscitelli.github.io/Glider.js/">here</a>
